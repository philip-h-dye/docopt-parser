Usage: exportlib [options] <dll>...

  Generate an import library from a DLL with symbols.  The import library
  will be droped alongside <dll> where it must be in order to to be useful.

  If <dll>'s directory is not writable, the import library will be placed
  in the current working directory.  Of absolutely no use there, but it
  is the best one can do under the circumstances.

Positional arguments :
  <dll>            The DLL file for which an import will be generated.

Optional arguments :
  -q, --quiet      Quiet unnessary informational output.
  -s, --silent     Silence even warnings like output to '.' due
                   to an unwritable <dll> directory.
  -i, --ignore     Ignore errors, simply continue on to the next <dll>.
  -n, --no-errors  Silence only the error messages.
  -d, --debug      Show internal handling such as parsed arguments.
  -h, --help       Show this help message and exit.
  --version        Show program version and exit.
