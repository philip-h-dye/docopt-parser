Unix Utility Usage Grammar
--------------------------

Or, a formal grammar for the docopy language.

First identify which elements must be parsed and which (if any) may be discarded (or perhaps remain free form text).

Characterize the delineations of each section sufficiently to write regular expression matchers for their start and end, or span.

Write a grammar to parse to just the sections out as blocks of free form text.  This forms the framework within which the section parsers will operate.

For each section independently write a grammar to parse the it.

One by one, incorporate the section parsers into the framework.
