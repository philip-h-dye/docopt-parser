2021/04/22 :
	- restructured as a python package under <top>/docopt_parser
	- tests in <top>/tests
	- the above is in preparation for massive overhaul of the grammar and code

2021/04/13 :
	- Migrating / restarting with Arpeggio Clean Peg
	- Parsimonious didn't workout.  Couldn't workaround some odd quirks or possibly bugs

2021/04/11 :
	- Started migration to Parsimonious.
	- Moved from src/python/optstruct/grammar to
	    src/python/parsers/paraimonious/docopt-parser

2021/04/10 :

	! Mysteriously lost an input value !

	Since I had enabled parseinfo, I decided to look into removing some of the manual tagging had been necesary without rule or node names.
    Was :
	usage_statment = program:program usage_expression:expression <newline> ;
    New version :
	usage_statment = program:program expression <newline> ;

	As it turns out, this very bad idea data-wise.  The grammar was unchanged except for the manual tagging.  Ran single.py with usage "Usage: hello <file>".  The results were certainly less cluttered, they no longer contained the operand, "<file>".  No errors, just silently dropped.

	I'm taking it as a sign that I should switch to Parsimonious immediately.
